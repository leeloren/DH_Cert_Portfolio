### Course Description
"This course will challenge the contemporary perception that medieval Europe was an all-white privileged masculine space by turning to creative works of the late medieval francophone world in which racialized, gendered and classed bodies take shape. Turning attention to medieval French works, ranging from romances, theatre, miracle texts to conquest literature, travel writing, and crusading propaganda from the 13-15^th^ centuries, this class will pursue new avenues in Medieval Studies that engage with contemporary critical identity studies. We will investigate the role of power and privilege in the formation of premodern identity, the politics of othering, and the question of subaltern agency in late medieval society. Our investigation will lead us to take a new intersectional view of “othering” in medieval culture that will push beyond the categories of Muslims, Jews, peasants, women, etc. to consider the combined impact of religion, race, class, sex/gender, and disability."
