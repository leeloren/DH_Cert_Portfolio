    "text": "Loren Easterday Lee\nI am the current Chair of the Graduate Student Committee of the Medieval Academy of America, responsible for all MAA GSC-sponsored programming. I likewise serve the UVA Medieval Studies Program, organizing events for all members of the UVA community of medievalists. For the 2024-2025 academic year, I am also the Digital Humanities Fellow of the Scholars’ Lab.\nIn addition to my studies at UVA, I have completed extensive coursework with Rare Book School, earning a certification in the History of Manuscripts. I was a pensionnaire étranger at the ENS in Paris for the 2023-2024 academic year at which time I was able to conduct manuscript research for my dissertation with the support of several major fellowships.\nMy research interests include representations of identity, women, and the body in pre-modern literature, particularly in hagiography. My dissertation focuses on medieval manuscript studies, digital humanities methods, editing, and translation studies. In addition to Modern French, I also read Old French, German, and Latin.\nBefore joining UVA, I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and French and Francophone Studies and a Master of Science degree in Theory and Practice in Teacher Education from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I then taught English and French at the secondary level for several years first outside of Montpellier, France and then in the Richmond, Virginia area.",

We will cover a range of historical, disciplinary, technical, and contemporary issues in the field, primarily in the context of literature, textual studies, and history, but also spatial matters, database and network analysis, machine learning and its critiques. Our plan is to introduce diverse cultural and epistemological issues and methods. Examples include how maps and other spatial and temporal perspectives are enabled by the digital; the conditions of print and archival materials in the age of digital reproduction; emergent/cy concerns about textual analysis, AI, privacy, security, surveillance. This course is also designed to introduce students to areas of DH activity at this university. Students should come away from the course with a solid understanding of the origin of digital humanities, the kinds of work done under that label, the opportunities to participate in DH research at UVA, the research insights offered by digital methods, and the applicability of those methods to the student’s own research interests. The course is required for all students enrolled in the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities. Thanks to John Unsworth (whose syllabus lays groundwork for this one), and to Brandon Walsh and Brad Pasanek, with whom I taught previous versions of DH courses.”\n\n\nWork Samples\nEssay 1: Intellectual Autobiography (1st draft)\nResearch Intervention: useR! 2022 Conference Abstract\nEssay 2: Embracing the Variorum (blog)\nCurricular Intervention: Digital Editing & Medieval Manuscripts\nEssay 3: Intellectual Autobiography (final)",

Turning attention to medieval French works, ranging from romances, theatre, miracle texts to conquest literature, travel writing, and crusading propaganda from the 13-15th centuries, this class will pursue new avenues in Medieval Studies that engage with contemporary critical identity studies. We will investigate the role of power and privilege in the formation of premodern identity, the politics of othering, and the question of subaltern agency in late medieval society. Our investigation will lead us to take a new intersectional view of “othering” in medieval culture that will push beyond the categories of Muslims, Jews, peasants, women, etc. to consider the combined impact of religion, race, class, sex/gender, and disability.”\n\n\nFinal Project\nFinal Paper: “Translation Trouble in Le Roman de Silence: A Test Case in Digital Editing for Polysemy”\nDigital Project: Digital Edition of Le Roman de Silence (verses 2439-2688)",
