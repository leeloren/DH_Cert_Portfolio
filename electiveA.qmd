## SARC 5400: Data Visualization
I enrolled in SARC 5400 with [Eric Field](https://www.arch.virginia.edu/people/eric-field) in Spring 2023. Below, you will find the course syllabus (updated for the most recent iteration of the course) as well as samples of my work from the course.

### Course Description
"This is a course about information and data visualization. We live in a world rich with information. This course teaches visual and spatial thinking coupled with data analysis tools and custom web-enabled programming to construct and envision information. To find and even invent approaches toward seeing into complex problems, we will study, and make, useful, compelling and beautiful tools to see."
